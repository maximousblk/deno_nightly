## Deno Nightly

ðŸŒ™ Nightly builds for Deno ðŸ¦•

If you are a module author or have been using Deno for a while you may have noticed updates unexpectedly breaking your applications. I believe this is done to avoid development of a bad standard and inability to fix it in the future.
Whatever the reason may be, your applications break because of these updates and you don't like it. Well, wouldn't it be amazing if you could somehow know about these changes before the update?
You can use these nightly builds to test your applications for future breaking. This way you can know what part of your application will break in the next update and prepare a fix before the official release.



## Builds

You can find all the builds on the [releases](https://github.com/maximousblk/deno_nightly/releases) page. All builds are tagged by the date they were built. Date format is `YYYY.MM.DD`. There is also a release named `latest` which is updated everyday with the latest build.

### Environment Variables

##### DENO_INSTALL

The directory in which to install Deno. This defaults to `$HOME/.deno`. The executable is placed in `$DENO_INSTALL/bin`

One application of this is a system-wide installation:

**With Shell (`/usr/local`):**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://denonightly.now.sh/install.sh | sudo DENO_INSTALL=/usr/local sh
````

**With PowerShell (`C:\Program Files\deno`):**

```powershell
# Run as administrator:
$env:DENO_INSTALL = "C:\Program Files\deno"
iwr https://denonightly.now.sh/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

## Compatibility

- The Shell installer can be used on Windows via the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

## Known Issues

#### Unzip is required

The program [`unzip`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/unzip) is a requirement for the Shell installer.

```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://denonightly.now.sh/install.sh | sh
Error: unzip is required to install Deno (see: https://github.com/maximousblk/deno_nightly#unzip-is-required).
```

**When does this issue occur?**

During the `install.sh` process, `unzip` is used to extract the zip archive.

**How can this issue be fixed?**

You can install unzip via `brew install unzip` on MacOS or `apt-get install unzip -y` on Linux.
