## Deno Nightly

ðŸŒ™ Nightly builds for Deno ðŸ¦•

###### HERE BE DRAGONS

This is an unofficial repository that provides nightly builds for [Deno](https://deno.land/).

It goes without saying but, **DO NOT** use these binaries in any production environments. They are untested and will most probably have bugs.

Any issues related to Deno do not belong here. If there is an issue with the build process used in this repo, be my guest.

Nothing in this repository is guaranteed to work. Any loss or harm caused due to these binaries is not my responsibility.

> If nothing is guaranteed to work, then who in there right mind would use these builds?

nerds.
